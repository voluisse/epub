  I believed you were a wonderful vision,
And I've been  watching you walk
You text that boy sometimes
A broken half a glass  smashing to the ground with you

  Well, fuck me then,
I love you, don't you mind don't you mind
It's alright, yeah it's alright;
                                (I'm losing my words
                                
  On this night and in this light
You're cold and I burn
My broken veins say I,I think I'm falling,  I'm falling for you
I'm on the verge of passing out

  And then you pointed at the bag of your dreams
Don't you see me? I'm so fixated,  you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
I'm broken and bleeding, and begging for help.
God, help me now because 
                          I'm not your savior
