<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a><b class="calibre3">Scheherazade</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake and dress them in warm clothes again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How it was late, and no one could sleep, the horses running until they forget that they are horses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere, it's more like a song on a policeman's radio, </p>
<p class="calibre1">how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Look at the light through the windowpane. That means it's noon, that means we're inconsolable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These, our bodies, possessed by light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tell me we'll never get used to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a><b class="calibre3">Dirty Valentine</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are so many things I'm not allowed to tell you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I touch myself, I dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wearing your clothes or standing in the shower for over an hour, pretending that this skin is your skin, these hands your hands, </p>
<p class="calibre1">these shins, these soapy flanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The musicians start the overture while I hide behind the microphone, trying to match the dubbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the big lips shining down from the screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We're filming the movie called Planet of Love-</p>
<p class="calibre1">there's sex of course, and ballroom dancing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">fancy clothes and waterlilies in the pond, and half the night you're a dependable chap, mounting the stairs in lamplight to the bath, but then the too white teeth all night, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all over the American sky, too much to bear, this constant fingering, your hands a river gesture, the birds in flight, the birds still singing outside the greasy window, in the trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There's a part in the movie</p>
<p class="calibre1">where you can see right through the acting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where you can tell that I'm about to burst into tears, </p>
<p class="calibre1">right before I burst into tears</p>
<p class="calibre1">and flee to the slimy moonlit riverbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">canopied with devastated clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We're shooting the scene where I swallow your heart and you make me spit it up again. I swallow your heart and it crawls</p>
<p class="calibre1">right out of my mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You swallow my heart and flee, but I want it back now, baby. I want it back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lying on the sofa with my eyes closed, I didn't want to see it this way, everything eating everything in the end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We know how the light works, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we know where the sound is coming from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Verse. Chorus. Verse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry. We know how it works. The world is no longer mysterious. </p>
