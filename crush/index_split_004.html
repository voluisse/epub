  <body class="calibre">
<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_3">4</h2>
<p class="calibre1">He had green eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so I wanted to sleep with him</p>
<p class="calibre1">green eyes flicked with yellow, dried leaves on the surface of a pool--</p>
<p class="calibre1">You could drown in those eyes, I said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact of his pulse, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>the way he pulled his body in, out of shyness or shame or a desire not to disturb the air around him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone could see the way his muscles worked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the way we look like animals, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his skin barely keeping him inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to take him home</p>
<p class="calibre1">and rough him up and get my hands inside him, drive my body into his like a crash test car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to be wanted and he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">very beautiful, kissed with his eyes closed, and only felt good while moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You could drown in those eyes, I said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so it's summer, so it's suicide, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so we're helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool. </p>
