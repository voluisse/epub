<p class="calibre1">What would you like? I'd like my money's worth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this--</p>
<p class="calibre1">swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the first four knuckles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We pull our boots on with both hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">but we can't punch ourselves awake and all I can do</p>
<p class="calibre1">is stand on the curb and say  <i class="calibre4">Sorry</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">                                                         about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn't get the boy to kill me, but I wore his jacket for the longest time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a><b class="calibre3">Seaside Improvisation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I take off my hands and I give them to you but you don't want them, so I take them back</p>
<p class="calibre1">and put them on the wrong way, the wrong wrists. The yard is dark, the tomatoes are next to the whitewashed wall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the book on the table is about Spain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the windows are painted shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tonight you're thinking of cities under crowns</p>
<p class="calibre1">of snow and I stare at you like I'm looking through a window, counting birds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me</p>
<p class="calibre1">you love this, tell me you're not miserable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You do the math, you expect the trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The seaside town. The electric fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Draw a circle with a piece of chalk. Imagine standing in a constant cone of light. Imagine surrender. Imagine being useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A stone on the path means the tea's not ready, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a stone in the hand means somebody's angry, the stone inside you still hasn't hit bottom. </p>
