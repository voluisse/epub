<p class="calibre1">I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything,</p>
<p class="calibre1">  without having to say that I ran out into the street to prove something,</p>
<p class="calibre1">                                                that he didn't love me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that I wanted to be possessed, thrown over, that I wanted to have the wounds nailed shut. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I want to tell you this story without having to be in it:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Max in the wrong clothes. Max at the party, drunk again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Max in the kitchen, in refrigerator light, his hands around the neck of a beer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">                                                      Tell me we're dead and I'll love you even more. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm surprised that I say it with feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">  There's a thing in my stomach about this. A simple thing. The last rung. </p>
