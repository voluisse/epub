<p class="calibre1">I want to tell you this story without having to say that I ran out into the street to prove something, that he chased after me</p>
<p class="calibre1">and threw me into the gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he knew it wasn't going to be okay, and he told me</p>
<p class="calibre1">it wasn't going to be okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he wouldn't kiss me, but he covered my body with his body and held me down until I promised not to run back out into the street again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the minutes don't stop. The prayer of going nowhere going nowhere. </p>
