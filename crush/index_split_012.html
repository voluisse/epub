<p class="calibre1">His shoulder blots out the starts but the minutes don't stop. He covers my body with his body but the minutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't stop. The smell of him mixed with creosote, exhaust --</p>
<p class="calibre1">There, on the ground, slipping through the minutes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to notch them. Like taking the same picture over and over, the spaces in between sealed up --</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knocked hard enough to make the record skip</p>
<p class="calibre1">and change its music, setting the melody on its</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward course again, circling and circling the center hole in the flat black disk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And words, little words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">words too small for any hope or promise, not really soothing but soothing nonetheless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a><b class="calibre3">Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out</b> Every morning the maple leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every morning another chapter where the hero shifts</p>
<p class="calibre1">from one foot to the other. Every morning the same big</p>
<p class="calibre1">and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out <i class="calibre4">You will be alone always and then you will die. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog of non-definitive acts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">something other than the desperation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear So-and-So, I'm sorry I couldn't come to your party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear So-and-So, I'm sorry I came to your party</p>
<p class="calibre1">and seduced you</p>
<p class="calibre1">and left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your want a better story. Who wouldn't? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Love on the water, love underwater, love, love</i> and so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing! Of course, she wakes the dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">flames everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can tell already you think I'm the dragon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that would be so like me, but I'm not. I'm not the dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm not the princess either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who am I? I'm just a writer. I write things down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I walk through your dreams and invent the future. Sure, I sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow glass, but that comes later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the part where I push you</p>
<p class="calibre1">flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks, shut up</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm getting to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a while I thought I was the dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I guess I can tell you that now. And, for a while, I thought I was the princess, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle, young and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with confidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess, while I'm out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire, and getting stabbed to death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay, so I'm the dragon. Bid deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You still get to be the hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You get the magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>                  What more do you want? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you're really there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let me do it right for once, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes, you know the story, simply heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside your head you hear a phone ringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">and when you open your eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside your head the sound of glass, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hello darling, sorry about that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we</p>
<p class="calibre1">lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially that, but I should have known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together to make a creature that will do what I say</p>
<p class="calibre1">or love me back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are  <i class="calibre4">not</i> feeding yourself to a bad man</p>
<p class="calibre1">against a black sky prickled with small lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I take it back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wooden halls likes caskets. These terms from the lower depths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I take them back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossed out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clumsy hands in a dark room. Crossed out. There is something underneath the floorboards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossed out. And here is the tabernacle</p>
<p class="calibre1">reconstructed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all forgiven, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even though we didn't deserve it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside your head you hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">a phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you're washing up in a stranger's bathroom, </p>
<p class="calibre1">standing by the window in a yellow towel, only twenty minutes away from the dirtiest thing you know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly darkness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly only darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>In the living room, in the broken yard, in the back of the car as the lights go by. In the airport bathroom's gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of</p>
<p class="calibre1">unnatural light, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view of the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I arrived in the city and you met me at the station, </p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling in a way</p>
<p class="calibre1">that made me frightened. Down the alley, around the arcade, up the stairs of the building</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things, I looked out the window and said</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">This doesn't look that much different from home, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">because it didn't, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but then I noticed the black sky and all those lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We walked through the house to the elevated train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful mechanical wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were inside the train car when I started to cry. You were crying too, smiling and crying in a way that made me</p>
<p class="calibre1">even more hysterical. You said I could have anything I wanted, but I just couldn't say it out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually, you said  <i class="calibre4">Love, for you, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">                              is larger than the usual romantic love. It's like a religion. It's</i> <i class="calibre4">                                                                               terrifying. No one</i> <i class="calibre4">                                                               will ever want to sleep with you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay, if you're so great, you do it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">here's the pencil, make it work . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the window is on your right, you are in your own bed. If the window is over your heart, and it is painted shut, then we are breathing river water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Build me a city and call it Jerusalem. Build me another and call it Jerusalem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have come back from Jerusalem where we found not</p>
<p class="calibre1">what we sought, so do it over, give me another version, a different room, another hallway, the kitchen painted over and over, </p>
<p class="calibre1">another bowl of soup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The entire history of human desire takes about seventy minutes to tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, we don't have that kind of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forget the dragon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>                                        Let's jump ahead to the moment of epiphany, in gold light, as the camera pans to where</p>
<p class="calibre1">the action is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">lakeside and backlit, and it all falls into frame, close enough to see the blue rings of my eyes as I say</p>
<p class="calibre1">something ugly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I never liked that ending either. More love streaming out the wrong way, and I don't want to be the kind that says  <i class="calibre4">the wrong way. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But it doesn't work, these erasures, this constant refolding of the pleats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were some nice parts, sure, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all lemondrop and mellonball, laughing in silk pajamas</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the grains of sugar</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the toast,  <i class="calibre4">love love</i> or whatever, take a number. I'm sorry it's such a lousy story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Forgiveness, you know that recently</p>
<p class="calibre1">we have had our difficulties and there are many things</p>
<p class="calibre1">I want to ask you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I tried that one time, high school, second lunch, and then again, years later, in the chlorinated pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I am still talking to you about help. I still do not have these luxuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have told you where I'm coming from, so put it together. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">We clutch our bellies and roll on the floor . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When I say this, it should mean laughter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not poison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I want more applesauce. I want more seats reserved for heroes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Forgiveness, I saved a plate for you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quit milling around the yard and come inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>II</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><b class="calibre3">Visible World</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow</p>
<p class="calibre1">flat on the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dawn was breaking the bones of your heart like twigs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You had not expected this, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the bedroom gone white, the astronomical light</p>
<p class="calibre1">pummeling you in a stream of fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You raised your hand to your face as if</p>
<p class="calibre1">to hide it, the pink fingers gone gold as the light</p>
<p class="calibre1">streamed straight to the bone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as if you were the small room closed in glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">with every speck of dust illuminated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light is no mystery, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the mystery is that there is something to keep the light from passing through. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A man walks into a bar and says:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Take my wife–please. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So you do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You take her out into the rain and you fall in love with her and she leaves you and you’re desolate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re on your back in your undershirt, a broken man</p>
<p class="calibre1">on an ugly bedspread, staring at the water stains</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And you can hear the man in the apartment above you</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking off his shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You hear the first boot hit the floor and you’re looking up, you’re waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">because you thought it would follow, you thought there would be some logic, perhaps, something to pull it all together</p>
<p class="calibre1">but here we are in the weeds again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">here we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the bowels of the thing: your world doesn’t make sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then the second boot falls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then a third, a fourth, a fifth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A man walks into a bar and says:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Take my wife–please. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But you take him instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You take him home, and you make him a cheese sandwich, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you try to get his shoes off, but he kicks you</p>
<p class="calibre1">and he keeps kicking you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You swallow a bottle of sleeping pills but they don’t work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boots continue to fall to the floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the apartment above you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You go to work the next day pretending nothing happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your co-workers ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">if everything’s okay and you tell them</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re just tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And you’re trying to smile. And they’re trying to smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says:</p>
