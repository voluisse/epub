<p class="calibre1">The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater because he is trying to kill you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you deserve it, you do, and you know this, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you are ready to die in this swimming pool</p>
<p class="calibre1">because you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this means your life is over anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to do long division, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t do, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore. </p>
