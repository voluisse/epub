<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The boy's no good. The boy is just no good. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">but he takes you in his arms and pushes your flesh around to see if you could ever be ugly to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You, the now familiar whipping boy, but you're beautiful, he can feel the dogs licking his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who gets the whip and who gets the hoops of flame? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He hits you and he hits you and he hits you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Desire driving his hands right into your body. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Hush, my sweet. These tornadoes are for you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">You wanted to think of yourself as someone who did these kinds of things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You wanted to be in love</p>
<p class="calibre1">and he happened to get in the way. </p>
