<p class="calibre1">The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit, </p>
<p class="calibre1">repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not your problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You have your own body to deal with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lamp by the bed is broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You are feeling things he's no longer in touch with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And everyone is speaking softly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so as not to wake one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind knocks the heads of the flowers together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steam rises from every cup at every table at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things happen all the time, things happen every minute</p>
<p class="calibre1">that have nothing to do with us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>             <i class="calibre4">  6</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So you say you want a deathbed scene, the knowledge that comes before knowledge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you want it dirty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And no one can ever figure out what you want, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you won't tell them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you realize the one person in the world who loves you isn't the one you thought it would be, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you don't trust him to love you in a way</p>
<p class="calibre1">you would enjoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the boy who loves you the wrong way is filthy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the boy who loves you the wrong way keeps weakening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You thought if you handed over your body</p>
<p class="calibre1">he'd do something interesting. </p>
