<p class="calibre1">The stranger says there are no more couches and he will have to sleep in your bed. You try to warn him, you tell him</p>
<p class="calibre1">you will want to get inside him, and ruin him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but he doesn't listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You do this, you do. You take the things you love</p>
<p class="calibre1">and tear them apart</p>
<p class="calibre1">or you pin them down with your body and pretend they're yours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, you kiss him, and he doesn't move, he doesn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">pull away, and you keep on kissing him. And he hasn't moved, he's frozen, and you've kissed him, and he'll never</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgive you, and maybe now he'll leave you alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a><b class="calibre3">Unfinished Duet</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At first there were too many branches</p>
<p class="calibre1">so he cut them and then it was winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">He meaning you. </i> Yes. He would look out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the window and stare at the trees that once</p>
<p class="calibre1">had too many branches and now seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to have too few.  <i class="calibre4">Is that all? </i> No, there were</p>
<p class="calibre1">other attempts, breakfasts: plates served, </p>
<p class="calibre1">plates carried away.  <i class="calibre4">He doesn't know</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">what to do with his hands. </i> He likes the feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the coffeepot.  <i class="calibre4">More than the hacksaw? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, and he likes flipping the chairs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">watching them fill with people. He likes</p>
<p class="calibre1">the orange juice and toast of it, and waxed</p>
<p class="calibre1">floors in any light.  <i class="calibre4">He wants to be tender</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">and merciful. </i> That sounds overly valorous. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Sounds like penance. And his hands? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">His hands keep turning into birds and</p>
<p class="calibre1">flying away from him.  <i class="calibre4">Him being you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes.  <i class="calibre4"> Do you love yourself? </i> I don't have to</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer that.  <i class="calibre4">It should matter. </i> He has a </p>
<p class="calibre1">body but it doesn't matter, clean sheets</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the bed but it doesn't matter.  <i class="calibre4">This is</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">where he trots out his sadness. Little black</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">cloud, little black umbrella. </i> You miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">the point: the face in the mirror is a little</p>
<p class="calibre1">traitor, the face in the mirror is a pale</p>
<p class="calibre1">and naked hostage and no one can tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">which room he's being held in.  <i class="calibre4">He wants</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">in, he wants out, he wants the antidote. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">He stands in front of the mirror with a net, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">hoping to catch something. </i> he wants to</p>
<p class="calibre1">move forward into the afternoon because</p>
<p class="calibre1">there is no other choice.  <i class="calibre4">Everyone in this</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">room got here somehow and everyone in</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">this room will have to leave. </i> So what's left? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sing a song about the room we're in? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hammer in the pegs that fix the meaning</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the landscape?  <i class="calibre4">The voice wants to be </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">a hand and the hand wants to do something</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">useful. What did you really want? </i> Someone </p>
<p class="calibre1">to pass this with me.  <i class="calibre4">You wanted more. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>I want what everyone wants.  <i class="calibre4">He raises</i> <i class="calibre4">the moon on a crane for effect, cue the violins. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That's what the violins are for. And yes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he raises the moon on a crane and scrubs it</p>
<p class="calibre1">until it shines.  <i class="calibre4">So what does it shine on? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing.  <i class="calibre4">Was there no one else? </i> Left-handed</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth, right-handed truth, there's no pure</p>
<p class="calibre1">way to say it.  <i class="calibre4">The wind blows and it makes</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">a noise. Pain makes a noise. We bang on</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the pipes and it makes a noise. Was there</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">no one else? </i> His hands keep turning into</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds, and his hands keep flying away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from him.  <i class="calibre4">Eventually the birds must land. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a><b class="calibre3">I Had a Dream About You</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">All the cows were falling out of the sky and landing in the mud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You were drinking sangria and I was throwing oranges at you, but it didn’t matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I said my arms are very long and your head’s on fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I said kiss me here and here and here</p>
<p class="calibre1">and you did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then you wanted pasta, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so we trampled out into the tomatoes and rolled around to make the sauce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You were very beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were in the Safeway parking lot. I couldn’t find my cigarettes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You said Hurry up! but I was worried there would be a holdup and we would be stuck in a hostage situation, hiding behind the frozen meats, with nothing to smoke for hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You said  <i class="calibre4">Don’t be silly</i>, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so I followed you into the store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were thumping the melons when I heard somebody say  <i class="calibre4">Nobody move! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I leaned over and whispered in your ear  <i class="calibre4">I told you so</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a show on the television about buried treasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You were trying to convince me that we should buy shovels and go out into the yard</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I was trying to convince you that I was a vampire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the way to the hardware store I kept biting your arm and you said if I really was a vampire I would be biting your neck, so I started biting your neck</p>
<p class="calibre1">and you said  <i class="calibre4">Cut it out! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">and you bought me an ice cream, and then we saw the UFO. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These are the dreams we should be having. I shouldn’t have to clean them up like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You were lying in the middle of the empty highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sky was red and the sand was red and you were wearing a brown coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were flecks of foam in the corners of your mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The birds were watching you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your eyes were closed and you were listening to the road and I could hear your breathing, I could hear your heart beating. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>                             I carried you to the car and drove you home but you weren’t making any sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">I took a shower and tried to catch my breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You were lying on top of the bedspread</p>
<p class="calibre1">in boxer shorts, watching cartoons and laughing but not making any sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your skin looked blue in the television light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your teeth looked yellow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still wet, I lay down next to you. Your arms, your legs, your naked chest, your ribs delineated like a junkyard dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">There’s nowhere to go</i>, I thought.  <i class="calibre4">There’s nowhere to go</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You were sitting in a bathtub at the hospital and you were crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You said it hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean the buildings that were not the hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I shouldn’t have mentioned the hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t think I can take this much longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the dream I don’t tell anyone, you put your head in my lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s say you’re driving down the road with your eyes closed but my eyes are also closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re by the side of the road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re by the side of the road and you’re doing all the talking while I stare at my shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re nice shoes, brown and comfortable, and I like your voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the dream I don’t tell anyone, I’m afraid to wake you up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In these dreams it’s always you:</p>
<p class="calibre1">the boy in the sweatshirt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the boy on the bridge, the boy who always keeps me</p>
<p class="calibre1">from jumping off the bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, the things we invent when we are scared</p>
<p class="calibre1">and want to be rescued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your jeep. Your teeth. The coffee that you bought me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sandwich cut in half on the plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I woke up and ate ice cream in the dark, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hunched over on the wooden chair in the kitchen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">listening to the rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I borrowed your shoes and didn’t put them away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>        You were crying and eating rice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The surface of the water was still and bright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your feet were burning so I put my hands on them, but my hands were burning too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You had a bottle of pills but I wouldn’t let you swallow them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You said  <i class="calibre4">Will you love me even more when Im dead? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And I said  <i class="calibre4">No</i>, and I threw the pills on the sand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Look at them</i>, you said.  <i class="calibre4">They look like emeralds</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I put you in the cage with the ocelots.  I was trying to fatten you up with sausage and bacon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow you escaped and climbed up the branches of a pear tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I chopped it down but there was no one in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I went to the riverbed to wait for you to show up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You didn't show up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I kept waiting. </p>
