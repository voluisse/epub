<p class="calibre1">Four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, fall down right there. I wanted to fall down right there but I knew you wouldn't catch me because you're dead.          I swallowed crushed ice pretending it was glass and you're dead. Ashes to ashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You wanted to be cremated so we cremated you and you wanted an adventure so I ran          and I knew you wouldn't catch me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening at the wrong end of a very long tunnel. </p>
