<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Here we are</h3>

<p class="calibre1">in the wrong tunnel, burn O burn, but it's cold, I have clothes all over my body, and it's raining, it wasn't supposed to. And there's snow on the TV, a landscape full of snow, falling from the fire-colored sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But thanks, thanks for calling it           <i class="calibre4">the blue sky</i> You can sleep now, you said. You can sleep now. You said that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had a dream where you said that. Thanks for saying that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You weren't supposed to. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a><b class="calibre3">Saying Your Names</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Chemical names, bird names, names of fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">and flight and snow, baby names, paint names, </p>
<p class="calibre1">delicate names like bones in the body, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rumplestiltskin names that are always changing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">names that no one’s ever able to figure out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Names of spells and names of hexes, names</p>
<p class="calibre1">cursed quietly under the breath, or called out</p>
<p class="calibre1">loudly to fill the yard, calling you inside again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">calling you home. Nicknames and pet names</p>
<p class="calibre1">and baroque French monikers, written in</p>
<p class="calibre1">shorthand, written in longhand, scrawled</p>
<p class="calibre1">illegibly in brown ink on the backs of yellowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">photographs, or embossed on envelopes lined</p>
<p class="calibre1">with gold. Names called out across the water, </p>
<p class="calibre1">names I called you behind your back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sour and delicious, secret and unrepeatable, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the names of flowers that open only once, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shouted from balconies, shouted from rooftops, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or muffled by pillows, or whispered in sleep, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or caught in the throat like a lump of meat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I try, I do. I try and try. A happy ending? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure enough —  <i class="calibre4">Hello darling, welcome home</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll call you darling, hold you tight. We are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Sweetheart, is that you? </i> There are no tears, </p>
<p class="calibre1">no pictures of him squarely. A seaside framed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in glass, and boats, those little boats with</p>
<p class="calibre1">sails aflutter, shining lights upon the water, </p>
<p class="calibre1">lights that splinter when they hit the pier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice on tape, his name on the envelope, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the soft sound of a body falling off a bridge</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind you, the body hardly even makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">a sound. The waters of the dead, a clear road, </p>
<p class="calibre1">every lover in the form of stars, the road</p>
<p class="calibre1">blocked. All night I stretched my arms across</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, rivers of blood, the dark woods, singing</p>
<p class="calibre1">with all my skin and bone  <i class="calibre4">Please keep him safe. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Let him lay his head on my chest and we will be</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">like sailors, swimming in the sound of it, dashed</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">to pieces. </i> Makes a cathedral, him pressing against me, his lips at my neck, and yes, I do believe</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me like stars. Names of heat and names of light, </p>
<p class="calibre1">names of collision in the dark, on the side of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bus, in the bark of the tree, in ballpoint pen</p>
<p class="calibre1">on jeans and hands and the backs of matchbooks</p>
<p class="calibre1">that then get lost. Names like pain cries, names</p>
<p class="calibre1">like tombstones, names forgotten and reinvented, </p>
<p class="calibre1">names forbidden or overused. Your name like</p>
<p class="calibre1">a song I sing to myself, your name like a box</p>
<p class="calibre1">where I keep my love, your name like a nest</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the tree of love, your name like a boat in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea of love — O now we’re in the sea of love! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your name like detergent in the washing machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your name like two X’s like punched-in eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like a drunk cartoon passed out in the gutter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">your name with two X’s to mark the spots, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to hold the place, to keep the treasure from</p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming ever lost. I’m saying your name</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the grocery store, I’m saying your name on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bridge at dawn. Your name like an animal</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered with frost, your name like a music that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">been transposed, a suit of fur, a coat of mud, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a kick in the pants, a lungful of glass, the sails</p>
<p class="calibre1">in wind and the slap of waves on the hull</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a boat that’s sinking to the sound of mermaids</p>
<p class="calibre1">singing songs of love, and the tug of a simple</p>
<p class="calibre1">profound sadness when it sounds so far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is a map with a your name for a capital, </p>
<p class="calibre1">here is an arrow to prove a point: we laugh</p>
<p class="calibre1">and it pits the world against us, we laugh, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and we’ve got nothing left to lose, and our hearts</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn red, and the river rises like a barn on fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I came to tell you, we’ll swim in the water, we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">swim like something sparkling underneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">the waves. Our bodies shivering, and the sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">of our breathing, and the shore so far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll use my body like a ladder, climbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the thing behind it, saying farewell to flesh, </p>
<p class="calibre1">farewell to everything caught underfoot</p>
<p class="calibre1">and flattened. Names of poisons, names of</p>
<p class="calibre1">handguns, names of places we’ve been</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, names of people we’d be together, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Names of endurance, names of devotion, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>street names and place names and all the names of our dark heaven crackling in their pan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a bed of straw, darling. It sure as shit is. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">If there was one thing I could save from the fire, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">he said, the broken arms of the sycamore, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the eucalyptus still trying to climb out of the yard —</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">your breath on my neck like a music that holds</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">my hands down, kisses as they burn their way</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">along my spine — or rain, our bodies wet, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">clothes clinging arm to elbow, clothes clinging</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">nipple to groin — I’ll be right here. I’m waiting. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Say hallelujah, say goodnight, say it over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the canned music and your feet won’t stumble, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his face getting larger, the rest blurring</p>
<p class="calibre1">on every side. And angels, about twelve angels, </p>
<p class="calibre1">angels knocking on your head right now, hello</p>
<p class="calibre1">hello, a flash in the sky, would you like to</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet him there, in Heaven? Imagine a room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a sudden glow. Here is my hand, my heart, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated</p>
<p class="calibre1">cities at the center of me, and here is the center</p>
<p class="calibre1">of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we</p>
<p class="calibre1">can drink from, but I can’t go through with it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I just don’t want to die anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>III</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a><b class="calibre3">Planet of Love</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">You're driving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sky's bright. You look great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a word, in a phrase, it's a movie, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you're the star. </p>
<p class="calibre1">so smile for the camera, it's your big scene, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you know your lines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm the director. I'm in a helicopter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have a megaphone and you play along, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because you want to die for love, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you always have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">You're pulling the car over. Somebody's waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You're going to die</p>
<p class="calibre1">in your best friend's arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And you play along because it's funny, because it's written down, you've memorized it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it's all you know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I say the phrases that keep it all going, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and everybody plays along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You didn't think you'd feel this way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There's a gun in your hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It feels hot. It feels oily. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm the director</p>
<p class="calibre1">and i'm screaming at you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm waving my arms in the sky, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and everyone's watching, everyone's</p>
<p class="calibre1">curious, everyone's</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding their breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a><b class="calibre3">Wishbone</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You saved my life </i> he says.  <i class="calibre4">I owe you everything. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">You don’t, I say, you don’t owe me squat, let’s just get going, let’s just get gone, but he’s relentless, </p>
<p class="calibre1">keeps saying   <i class="calibre4">I owe you, </i> says   <i class="calibre4">Your shoes are filling with your own</i> <i class="calibre4">damn blood, you must want something, just tell me, and it’s yours. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But I can’t look at him, can hardly speak, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, I’d just as soon kill you myself, I say.  You keep saying   <i class="calibre4">I owe you, I owe…</i> but you say the same thing every time.   Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not because I don’t believe it, not because I want it any different, but I’m always saving and you’re always owing and I’m tired of asking to settle the debt.  Don’t bother.  You never mean it </p>
<p class="calibre1">anyway, not really, and it only makes me that much more ashamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s only one thing I want, don’t make me say it, just get me bandages, I’m bleeding,  I’m not just making conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s smashed glass glittering everywhere like stars. It’s a Western, Henry.  It’s a downright shoot-em-up. We’ve made a graveyard out of the bone white afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s another wrong-man-dies scenario and we keep doing it, Henry, keep saying   <i class="calibre4">until we get it right…</i>  but we always win and we never quit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">See, we’ve won again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">here we are at the place where I get to beg for it where I get to say  <i class="calibre4">Please</i>, <i class="calibre4">for just one night, will you lay down next to me, we can leave our clothes on,</i> <i class="calibre4">                 we can stay all buttoned up? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But we both know how it goes–– I say  <i class="calibre4">I want you inside me </i> and you hold my head underwater, I say  <i class="calibre4">I want you inside me</i> and you split me open with a knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m battling monsters, I’m pulling you out of the burning buildings and you say   <i class="calibre4">I’ll give you anything </i> but you never come through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when you’re standing up</p>
<p class="calibre1">you look like you’re lying down, but will you let me kiss your neck, baby? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do I have to tie your arms down?  Do I have to stick my tongue in your mouth like the hand of a thief, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like a burglary, like it’s just another petty theft? It makes me tired, Henry. Do you see what I mean?  Do you see what I’m getting at? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I swear, I end up </p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling empty, like you’ve taken something out of me, and I have to search my body for the scars, thinking  <i class="calibre4">Did he find that one last tender place to</i> <i class="calibre4">                sink his teeth in? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I know you want me to say it, Henry, it’s in the script, you want me to say <i class="calibre4">Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>                but I think I’d rather keep the bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s mine, see, I’m not giving it up. This way you still owe me, and that’s as good as anything.  You can’t get out of this one, Henry, you can’t get it out of me, and with this bullet lodged in my chest, </p>
<p class="calibre1">covered with your name, I will turn myself into a gun, because I’m hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own. I’ll be your slaughterhouse, your killing floor, your morgue </p>
<p class="calibre1">and final resting, walking around with this bullet inside me like the bullet was already there, like it’s been waiting inside me the whole time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you want it? Do you want anything I have? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will you throw me to the ground like you mean it, reach inside and wrestle it out with your bare hands? If you love me, Henry, you don’t love me in a way I understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you know how it ends? Do you feel lucky? Do you want to go home now?  There’s a bottle of whiskey in the trunk of the Chevy and a dead man at our feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring up at us like we’re something interesting.  This is where the evening splits in half, Henry, love or death. Grab an end, pull hard, and make a wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a><b class="calibre3">Driving, Not Washing</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It starts with bloodshed, always bloodshed, always the same <i class="calibre4">running from something larger than yourself</i> story, shoving money into the jaws of a suitcase, cutting your hair with a steak knife at a rest stop, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you're off, you're on the run, a fugitive driving away from something shameful and half-remembered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They're hurling their bodies down the freeway</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the smell of gasoline, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which is the sound of a voice saying I told you so. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Yes, you did dear. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Every story has its chapter in the desert, the long slide from kingdom to kingdom through the wilderness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where you learn things, where you're left to your own devices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry's driving, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Theodore's bleeding shotgun into the upholstery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's a road movie, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a double-feature, two boys striking out across America, while desire, like a monster, crawls up out of the lake</p>
<p class="calibre1">with all of us watching, with all of us wondering if these two boys will find a way to figure it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is the black box, the shut eye, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the bullet pearling in his living skin. This boy, half-destroyed, screaming  <i class="calibre4">Drive into that tree, drive off the embankment. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">                                                                               Henry, make something happen. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But angels are pouring out of the farmland, angels are swarming over the grassland, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angels rising from their little dens, arms swinging, wings aflutter, dropping their white-hot bombs of love. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">We are not dirty, </i> he keeps saying.  <i class="calibre4">We are not dirty... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">They want you to love the whole damn world but you won't, you want it all narrowed down to one fleshy man in the bath, who knows what to do with his body, with his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It should follow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you know this, like the panels of a comic strip, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we should be belted in, but you still can't get beyond your skin, and they're trying to drive you into the ground, to see if anything walks away. </p>
