  <body class="calibre">
<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_25">3</h2>
<p class="calibre1">You wonder what he's thinking when he shivers like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What can you tell me, what could you possibly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">tell me? </i> Sure, it's good to feel things, and if it hurts, we're doing it to ourselves, or so the saying goes, but there should be a different music here. There should be just one safe place in the world, I mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">this world. People get hurt here. People fall down and stay down and I don't like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>              the way the song goes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You, the moon. You, the road. You, the little flowers</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the side of the road. You keep singing along to that song I hate. Stop singing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a><b class="calibre3">The Dislocated Room</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It was night for many miles and then the real stars in the purple sky, like little boats rowed out too far, </p>
<p class="calibre1">begin to disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there, in the distance, not the promised land, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but a Holiday Inn, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with bougainvillea growing through the chain link by the pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door swung wide: twin beds, twin lamps, twin plastic cups wrapped up in cellophane</p>
<p class="calibre1">and he says  <i class="calibre4">No Henry, let's not do this. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Can you see the plot like dotted lines across the room? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is the sink to wash away the blood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">here's the whiskey, the ripped-up shirt, the tile of the bathroom floor, the disk of the drain</p>
<p class="calibre1">punched through with holes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here's the boy like a sack of meat, here are the engines, the little room that is not a room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Henry that is not a Henry, the Henry with a needle and thread, hovering over the hollow boy passed out</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the universal bedspread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here he is again, being sewn up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So now we have come to a great battlefield, the warmth of the fire, the fire still burning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the heat escaping like a broken promise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the part where you wake up in your clothes again, this is the part where you're trying to stay inside the building. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Stay in the room for now, </i> he says.  <i class="calibre4">Stay in the room</i> <i class="calibre4">                                                       for now. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the place, you say to yourself, this is the place where everything starts to begin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the wounds reveal a thicker skin and suddenly there is no floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there is something underneath the building that is trying very hard to get your attention---</p>
<p class="calibre1">a man with almond eyes and a zipper that runs the length of his spine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You can see the shadow that the man is throwing across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the linoleum, </p>
<p class="calibre1">how it resembles a boat, how it crosses the tiles just so, the masts of his arms rasping against the windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He's pointing at you with a glass of milk</p>
<p class="calibre1">as if he's trying to tell you that there is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>some sort of shining star now buried deep inside you and he has to dig it out with a knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bell rings, the dog growls, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and then the wind picking up, and the light falling, and his mouth flickering, and the dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">howling, and the window closing tight against the dirty rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is the hallway and here are the doors and here is the fear of the other thing, the relentless</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, your body drowning in gravity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the in-between, the waiting that happens in the space between</p>
<p class="calibre1">one note and the next, the place where you confuse</p>
<p class="calibre1">his hands with the room, the dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the man, the blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the ripped-up sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He puts his hands all over you to keep you in the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's night. It's noon. He's driving. It's happening</p>
<p class="calibre1">all over again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's love or it isn't. It isn't over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You're in a car. You're in the weeds again. You're on a bumpy road and there are criminals everywhere, </p>
<p class="calibre1">longing for danger. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Henry</i>, he's saying.  <i class="calibre4">Who is it that's talking? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I thought I heard the clink</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">          of ice to teeth. I thought I heard the clink of teeth to glass. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Open the door and the light falls in. Open your mouth and it falls right out again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He's on top of you. He's next to you, right next to you in fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He has the softest skin wrapped entirely around him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It isn't him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It isn't you. You're falling now. You're swimming. This is not harmless. You are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing. You're climbing out of the chlorinated pool again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have not been given all the words necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have not been given anything at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We've been driving all night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We've been driving a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We want to stop. We can't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is there an acceptable result? Do we mean something when we talk? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is it enough that we are shuddering</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the sound? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Left hand raising the fork to the mouth, feeling the meat slide down your throat, thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>            <i class="calibre4">My throat. Mine. Everything in this cone of light is mine. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The ashtray and the broken lamp, the filthy orange curtains and his ruined shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">              I've been in your body, baby, and it was paradise. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">     I've been in your body and it was a carnival ride. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">They want to stop but they can't stop. They don't know what they're doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not harmless, the  <i class="calibre4">how to touch it</i>, we do not want the screen completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">lifted from our eyes, just lifted long enough to see the holes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tired and sore and rubbed the wrong way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbed raw and throbbing in the light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They want to stop but they don't stop. They cannot get the bullet out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Cut me open and the light streams out. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">    Stitch me up and the light keeps streaming out between</i> <i class="calibre4">                                               the stitches. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He cannot get the bullet out, he thinks, he can't, and then he does. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A little piece of grit to build a pearl around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Midnight June. Midnight July. They've been going at it for days now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting the bullet out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digging out the bullet and holding it up to the light, the light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digging out the bullet and holding it up to the light. </p>
