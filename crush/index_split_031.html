<p class="calibre1">Let's say God in his High Heaven is hungry and has decided to make himself some tuna fish sandwiches. He's already finished making two of them, on sourdough, before he realizes that the fish is bad. What is he going to do with these sandwiches? They're already made, but he doesn't want to eat them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let's say the Devil is played by two men. We'll call them Jeff. Dark hair, green eyes, white teeth, pink tonguesâ€”they're twins. The one on the left has gone bad in the middle, and the other one on the left is about to. As they wrestle, you can tell that they have forgotten about God, and they are very hungry. </p>
