<p class="calibre1">You are playing cards with three men named Jeff. Two of the Jeffs seem somewhat familiar, but the Jeff across from you keeps staring at your hands, your mouth, and you're certain that you've never seen this Jeff before. But he's on your team, and you're ahead, you're winning big, and yet the other Jeffs keep smiling at you like there's no tomorrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all have perfect teeth: white, square, clean, even. And, for some reason, the lighting in the room makes their teeth seem closer than they should be, as if each mouth was a place, a living room with pink carpet and the window's open.  <i class="calibre4">Come back from the window, Jefferson. Take off</i> <i class="calibre4">those wet clothes and come over here, by the fire. </i></p>
