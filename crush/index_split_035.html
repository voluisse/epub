  <body class="calibre">
<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_34">9</h2>
<p class="calibre1">You are in an ordinary suburban bedroom with bunk beds, a bookshelf, two wooden desks and chairs. You are lying on your back, on the top bunk, very close to the textured ceiling, staring straight at it in fact, and the room is still dark except for a wedge of powdery light that spills in from the adjoining bathroom. The bathroom is covered in mint green tile and someone is in there, singing very softly. Is he singing to you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">For you? Black cherries in chocolate, the ring around the moon, a bee-tle underneath a glassâ€”you cannot make out all the words, but you're sure he knows you're in there, and he's singing to you, even though you don't know who he is. </p>
