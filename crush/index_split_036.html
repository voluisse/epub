<p class="calibre1">You see it as a room, a tabernacle, the dark hotel. You're in the hallway again, and you open the door, and if you're ready you'll see it, but maybe one part of your mind decides that the other parts aren't ready, and then you don't remember where you've been, and you find yourself down the hall again, the lights gone dim as the left hand sings the right hand back to sleep. It's a puzzle: each piece, each room, each time you put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, your ear to the wound that whispers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You're in the hallway again. The radio is playing your favorite song. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You're in the hallway. Open the door again. Open the door. </p>
