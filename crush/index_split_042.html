<p class="calibre1">You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The booths are plush and the drinks are cheap and in this dim and smoky light you can barely tell whose hands are whose. Someone raises their glass for a toast. Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy? The bartender smiles, running a rag across the burnished wood of the bar. The drink in front of you has already been paid for. Drink it, the bartender says.  <i class="calibre4">It's yours, you deserve it. It's already been paid for. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Somebody's paid for it already. There's no mistake, he says. It's your drink,</i> <i class="calibre4">the one you asked for, just the way you like it. How can you refuse</i> Hands of fire, hands of air, hands of water, hands of dirt. Someone's doing all the talking but no one's lips move. Consider the hairpin turn. </p>
