<p class="calibre1">Two brothers: one of them wants to take you apart. Two brothers: one of them wants to put you back together. It's time to choose sides now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stitches or the devouring mouth? You want an alibi? You don't get an alibi, you get two brothers. Here are two Jeffs. Pick one. This is how you make the meaning, you take two things and try to define the space between them. Jeff or Jeff? Who do you want to be? You just wanted to play in your own backyard, but you don't know where your own yard is, exactly. You just wanted to prove there was one safe place, just one safe place where you could love him. You have not found that place yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You have not made that place yet. You are here. You are here. You're still right here. </p>
