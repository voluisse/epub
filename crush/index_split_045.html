<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_44">19</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Here are your names and here is the list and here are the things you left behind: The mark on the floor from pushing your chair back, your underwear, one half brick of cheese, the kind I don't like, wrapped up, and poorly, and abandoned on the second shelf next to the poppyseed dress-ing, which is also yours. Here's the champagne on the floor, and here are your house keys, and here are the curtains that your cat peed on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And here is your cat, who keeps eating grass and vomiting in the hallway. Here is the list with all of your names, Jeff. They're not the same name, Jeff. They're not the same at all. </p>
