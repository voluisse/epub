  <body class="calibre">
<h2 class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_49">24</h2>
<p class="calibre1">You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like you've done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and you're tired. You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and you're trying not to tell him that you love him, and you're trying to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>choke down the feeling, and you're trembling, but he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist, and you feel your heart taking root in your body, like you've discovered something you don't even have a name for. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a><b class="calibre3">Meanwhile</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Driving, dogs barking, how you get used to it, how you make the new street yours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trees outside the window and a big band sound that makes you feel like everything's okay, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a feeling that lasts for one song maybe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the parentheses all clicking shut behind you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The way we move through time and space, or only time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The way it's night for many miles, and then suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">it's not, it's breakfast</p>
<p class="calibre1">and you're standing in the shower for over an hour, </p>
<p class="calibre1">holding the bar of soap up to the light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I will keep watch.  I will water the yard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knot the tie and go to work.  Unknot the tie and go to sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I sleep.  I dream.  I make up things</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I would never say.  I say them very quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The trees in wind, the streetlights on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the click and flash of cigarettes</p>
<p class="calibre1">being smoked on the lawn, and just a little kiss before we say goodnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It spins like a wheel inside you: green yellow, green blue, green beautiful green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's simple: it isn't over, it's just begun.  It's green.  It's still green. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a><b class="calibre3">Snow and Dirty Rain</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Close your eyes. A lover is standing too close</p>
<p class="calibre1">to focus on. Leave me blurry and fall toward me</p>
<p class="calibre1">with your entire body. Lie under the covers, pretending to sleep, while I’m in the other room. Imagine</p>
<p class="calibre1">my legs crossed, my hair combed, the shine of my boots</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the slatted light. I’m thinking  <i class="calibre4">My plant, his chair,</i> <i class="calibre4">the ashtray that we bought together. </i> I’m thinking  <i class="calibre4">This is where</i> <i class="calibre4">we live. </i> When we were little we made houses out of cardboard boxes. We can do anything. It’s not because</p>
<p class="calibre1">our hearts are large, they’re not, it’s what we</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggle with. The attempt to say  <i class="calibre4">Come over. </i>  <i class="calibre4">Bring</i> <i class="calibre4">your friends. It’s a potluck, I’m making pork chops, I’m making</i> <i class="calibre4">those long noodles you love so much. </i> My dragonfly, my black-eyed fire, the knives in the kitchen are singing for blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw, and this is the map of my heart, the landscape</p>
<p class="calibre1">after cruelty which is, of course, a garden, which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a tenderness, which is a room, a lover saying  <i class="calibre4">Hold me</i> <i class="calibre4">tight, it’s getting cold. </i> We have not touched the stars, nor are we forgiven, which brings us back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the hero’s shoulders and the gentleness that comes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not from the absence of violence, but despite</p>
<p class="calibre1">the abundance of it. The lawn drowned, the sky on fire, the gold light falling backward through the glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">of every room. I’ll give you my heart to make a place</p>
<p class="calibre1">for it to happen, evidence of a love that transcends hunger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is that too much to expect? That I would name the stars for you? That I would take you there? The splash</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube? We’ve read</p>
<p class="calibre1">the back of the book, we know what’s going to happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fields burned, the land destroyed, the lovers left</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken in the brown dirt. And then it’s gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makes you sad. All your friends are gone. Goodbye</p>
<p class="calibre1">Goodbye. No more tears. I would like to meet you all</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Heaven. But there’s a litany of dreams that happens</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere in the middle. Moonlight spilling</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the bathroom floor. A page of the book where we</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcend the story of our lives, past the taco stands</p>
<p class="calibre1">and record stores. Moonlight making crosses</p>
<p class="calibre1">on your body, and me putting my mouth on every one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have been very brave, we have wanted to know</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>the worst, wanted the curtain to be lifted from our eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This dream going on with all of us in it. Penciling in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bighearted slob. Penciling in his outstretched arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Our father who art in Heaven. Our father who art buried</i> <i class="calibre4">in the yard. </i> Someone is digging your grave right now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone is drawing a bath to wash you clean, he said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so think of the wind, so happy, so warm. It’s a fairy tale, the story underneath the story, sliding down the polished halls, lightning here and gone. We make these</p>
<p class="calibre1">ridiculous idols so we can to what’s behind them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but what happens after we get up the ladder? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do we simply stare at what’s horrible and forgive it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is the river, and here is the box, and here are</p>
<p class="calibre1">the monsters we put in the box to test our strength</p>
<p class="calibre1">against. Here is the cake, and here is the fork, and here’s the desire to put it inside us, and then the question</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind every question:  <i class="calibre4">What happens next? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The way you slam your body into mine reminds me</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m alive, but monsters are always hungry, darling, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and they’re only a few steps behind you, finding</p>
<p class="calibre1">the flaw, the poor weld, the place where we weren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">stitched up quite right, the place they could almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">slip right into through if the skin wasn’t trying to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep them out, to keep them here, on the other side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the theater where the curtain keeps rising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I crawled out the window and ran into the woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had to make up all the words myself. The way</p>
<p class="calibre1">they taste, the way they sound in the air. I passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the narrow gate, stumbled in, stumbled</p>
<p class="calibre1">around for a while, and stumbled back out. I made</p>
<p class="calibre1">this place for you. A place for to love me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If this isn’t a kingdom then I don’t know what is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So how would you catalog it? Dawn in the fields? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snow and dirty rain? Light brought in in buckets? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was trying to describe the kingdom, but the letters</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept smudging as I wrote them: the hunter’s heart, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the hunter’s mouth, the trees and the trees and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">space between the trees, swimming in gold. The words</p>
<p class="calibre1">frozen. The creatures frozen. The plum sauce</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaking out of the bag. Explaining will get us nowhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was away, I don’t know where, lying on the floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pretending I was dead. I wanted to hurt you</p>
<p class="calibre1">but the victory is that I could not stomach it.  <i class="calibre4">We have</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a> <i class="calibre4">swallowed him up, </i> they said.  <i class="calibre4">It’s beautiful. It really is. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I had a dream about you. We were in the gold room</p>
<p class="calibre1">where everyone finally gets what they want. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You said  <i class="calibre4">Tell me about your books, your visions made</i> <i class="calibre4">of flesh and light </i> and I said  <i class="calibre4">This is the Moon. This is</i> <i class="calibre4">the Sun. Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you</i> <i class="calibre4">there. The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar</i> <i class="calibre4">cube… </i> We were in the gold room where everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">finally gets what they want, so I said  <i class="calibre4">What do you</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">want, sweetheart? </i> and you said  <i class="calibre4">Kiss me. </i> Here I am leaving you clues. I am singing now while Rome</p>
<p class="calibre1">burns. We are all just trying to be holy. My applejack, my silent night, just mash your lips against me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We are all going forward. None of us are going back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">FIN</i></p>
